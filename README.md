# Austral

![Build status badge](https://github.com/austral/austral/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

Austral is a new language.

Features:

- **Linear types**: linear types allow resources to be handled in a
  provably-safe manner. Memory can be managed safely and without runtime
  overhead, avoiding double `free()`, use-after-`free` errors, and double fetch
  errors. Other resources like file or database handles can also be handled
  safely.

- **Capabilities**: linear [capabilities][cap] enable fine-grained permissioned
  access to low-level facilities. Third-party dependencies can be constrained in
  what types of resources they can access. This makes the language less
  vulnerable to [supply chain attacks][sca].

- **Typeclasses**: typeclasses, borrowed from Haskell, allow for bounded ad-hoc
  polymorphism.

- **Safe Arithmetic**: Austral has well-defined semantics for all arithmetic
  operations on numeric types. There are distinct operations for
  trap-on-overflow arithmetic and modular arithmetic, as in Ada.

- **Algebraic Data Types**: algebraic data types, as in ML or Haskell, with
  exhaustiveness checking.

Anti-features:

- No garbage collection.
- No destructors.
- No exceptions (and no surprise control flow).
- No implicit function calls.
- No implicit type conversions.
- No global state.
- No subtyping.
- No macros.
- No reflection.
- No Java-style @Annotations.
- No type inference, type information flows in one direction.
- No uninitialized variables.
- No pre/post increment/decrement (`x++` in C).
- No first-class async.
- No function overloading (except through typeclasses, where it is bounded).
- No arithmetic precedence.
- No variable shadowing.

## Example

Calculate and print the 10th Fibonacci number:

```ml
module body Fib is
    function fib(n: Nat64): Nat64 is
        if n < 2 then
            return n;
        else
            return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        end if;
    end;

    function main(): ExitCode is
        print("fib(10) = ");
        printLn(fib(10));
        return ExitSuccess();
    end;
end module body.
```

Build and run:

```bash
$ austral compile fib.aum --entrypoint=Fib:main --output=fib
$ ./fib
fib(10) = 55
```

## Building with Nix

If you have [Nix][nix], this will be much simpler. Just:

[nix]: https://nixos.org/

```bash
$ nix-shell
$ make
```

And you're done.

## Building without Nix

Building the `austral` compiler requires `make` and the `dune` build system for
OCaml, and a C compiler for building the resulting output. You should install
OCaml 4.13.0 or above.

First:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:austral/austral.git
$ cd austral
```

Next, install [opam][opam]. On Debian/Ubuntu you can just do:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install opam
$ opam init
```

Then, create an opam switch for austral and install dependencies via opam:

```bash
opam switch create austral 4.13.0
eval $(opam env --switch=austral)
opam install --deps-only -y .
```

Finally:
```bash
make
```

To run the tests:

```bash
$ ./run-tests.sh
```

To build the standard library:

```bash
$ cd standard
$ make
```

## Usage

Suppose you have a program with modules `A`, `B`, and `C`, in the following
files:

```
src/A.aui
src/A.aum

src/B.aui
src/B.aum

src/C.aui
src/C.aum
```

To compile this, run:

```bash
$ austral compile \
    src/A.aui,src/A.aum \
    src/B.aui,src/B.aum \
    src/C.aui,src/C.aum \
    --entrypoint=C:main \
    --output=program
```

The `--entrypoint` option must be the name of a module, followed by a colon,
followed by the name of a public function with either of the following
signatures:

1. `function main(): ExitCode;`
2. `function main(root: RootCapability): ExitCode;`

The `ExitCode` type has two constructors: `ExitSuccess()` and `ExitFailure()`.

Finally, the `--output` option is just the path to dump the compiled C to.

By default, the compiler will emit C code and invoke `cc` automatically to
produce an executable. To just produce C code, use:

```bash
$ austral compile --target-type=c [modules...] --entrypoint=Foo:main --output=program.c
```

If you don't need an entrypoint (because you're compiling a library), instead of
`--entrypoint` you have to pass `--no-entrypoint`:

```bash
$ austral compile --target-type=c [modules...] --no-entrypoint --output=program.c
```

If you just want to typecheck without compiling, use the `tc` target type:

```bash
$ austral compile --target-type=tc [modules...]
```

Generated C code should be compiled with:

```bash
$ gcc -fwrapv generated.c -lm
```

## Status

1. The bootstrapping compiler, written in OCaml, is implemented. The main
   limitation is it does not support separate compilation. In practice this is
   not a problem: there's not enough Austral code for this to matter.

2. The compiler implements every feature of the spec.

3. A standard library with a few basic data structures and capability-based
   filesystem access is being designed.
